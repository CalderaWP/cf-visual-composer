Adds a Visual Composer shortcode for Caldera Forms, with option to open in modal.

<strong>This Is A Beta, I Made On A Crazy Friday Night. It probably works.</strong>

Another fine add-on for [Caldera Forms](https://CalderaWP.com/caldera-forms) by [CalderaWP](https://CalderaWP.com)

## Using It
* [Make sure you have Caldera Forms installed first](https://wordpress.org/plugins/caldera-forms/)
* Add element to grid
* Go to content section
* Choose Caldera Forms
* Select a form from the dropdown
* If you want to show the form in the grid, not open it in a modal, you're done, click "Save Changes"
* If you want to show the form in a modal, check the "Load In Modal" option"
* In the "Text For Button To Open Modal" field, set what you want, that opens the button to say.
* Click "Save Changes"

## Important Notes
* If you're using a modal for your form, the modal will not open when you are using the front-end editor. I'm working on this. It should work when not editing.
* Caldera Forms is pretty dependent on jQuery. If you have JavaScript errors in your console, or your using a version of jQuery besides the one WordPress ships with, it might not work.
